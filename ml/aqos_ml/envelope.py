"""The reclassifier's check, as the ML side defines it (chunk 7A).

A labelled flow is compared once a second with the normal range of its
class: envelopes.json, the 5th to 95th percentile of each window statistic
over that class's training flows. A flow that stays outside goes back to
the classifier. The controller does the check itself, in Go
(internal/reclass); this file is the definition it must agree with.

  python -m aqos_ml.envelope cases   # rewrite the test cases the Go check must pass
  python -m aqos_ml.envelope rates --dataset data/dataset/v1.jsonl.gz
        # how often flows that have not changed would be sent back, for k = 1 to 3

Settings are the starting values of the technical specification, 9.1.
