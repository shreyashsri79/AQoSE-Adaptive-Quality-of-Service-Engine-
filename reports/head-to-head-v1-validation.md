# Offline head-to-head: v1, validation split

Dataset `v1` (sha256 `fe91bbad5e5e`), 3607 flows from 370 sessions. Damage table: `damage_table.yaml` (measured). Every flow counts once and every class counts the same.

## Verdict: go

- LightGBM, expected damage (O2) has lower balanced expected damage than the tuned rules: 0.141 against 0.745 (difference -0.604, 95% interval -0.693 to -0.517).
- Video calls (443 flows): damage 0.01 against the rules' 1.52; sent to Bulk 0% against 0%.
- Cloud gaming (106 flows): damage 0.02 against the rules' 0.85; sent to Bulk 0% against 2%.

## Scores

| Contestant | Balanced expected damage | Against tuned rules (95% interval) | Accuracy | Macro-F1 | Calibration error |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Rules, qosify defaults | 1.991 | +1.246 (+1.031 to +1.485) | 0.460 | 0.110 |  |
| Rules, tuned (4000 pkt/s, 1200 B) | 0.745 |  | 0.418 | 0.104 |  |
| Random forest, top label (O1) | 0.279 | -0.466 (-0.524 to -0.396) | 0.942 | 0.719 | 0.025 |
| Random forest, expected damage (O2) | 0.146 | -0.599 (-0.687 to -0.514) | 0.942 | 0.719 | 0.025 |
| LightGBM, top label (O1) | 0.294 | -0.451 (-0.524 to -0.356) | 0.944 | 0.735 | 0.052 |
| LightGBM, expected damage (O2) | 0.141 | -0.604 (-0.693 to -0.517) | 0.944 | 0.735 | 0.052 |

Lower damage is better. The interval comes from resampling whole sessions 2,000 times; one that stays below zero means the contestant beats the tuned rules.

## Has the model learned the lab?

LightGBM trained without each source in turn, then scored on that source's flows by expected damage. A class the model can only place when it has seen that source's own recordings shows up here as high damage.
